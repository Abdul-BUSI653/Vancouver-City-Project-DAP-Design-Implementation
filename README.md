# Project Description: Descriptive Analysis of Lost and Found Animal Records
In this assignment I will be describing the details of the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implementation (the datasets used and the various derivations and DAP design using the datasets I selected. For this assignment I used the website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/parks/table/?dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjaGFydHMiOlt7InR5cGUiOiJjb2x1bW4iLCJmdW5jIjoiU1VNIiwieUF4aXMiOiJoZWN0YXJlIiwic2NpZW50aWZpY0Rpc3BsYXkiOnRydWUsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAyNzlCMSJ9XSwieEF4aXMiOiJuZWlnaGJvdXJob29kbmFtZSIsIm1heHBvaW50cyI6NTAsInNvcnQiOiIiLCJzZXJpZXNCcmVha2Rvd25UaW1lc2NhbGUiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6InBhcmtzIiwib3B0aW9ucyI6e319fV0sInRpbWVzY2FsZSI6IiIsImRpc3BsYXlMZWdlbmQiOnRydWUsImFsaWduTW9udGgiOnRydWV9&location=11,49.22852,-123.12388) for getting some open source available datasets for various segments related to the Vancouver City operations.

## Project Title: Understanding Yearly Lost and Found Animal Patterns
The primary need of this project is to conduct a descriptive and Exploratory Analysis of Vancouver City Parks based on the datasets taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/parks/table/?dataChart=eyJxdWVyaWVzIjpbeyJjaGFydHMiOlt7InR5cGUiOiJjb2x1bW4iLCJmdW5jIjoiU1VNIiwieUF4aXMiOiJoZWN0YXJlIiwic2NpZW50aWZpY0Rpc3BsYXkiOnRydWUsImNvbG9yIjoiIzAyNzlCMSJ9XSwieEF4aXMiOiJuZWlnaGJvdXJob29kbmFtZSIsIm1heHBvaW50cyI6NTAsInNvcnQiOiIiLCJzZXJpZXNCcmVha2Rvd25UaW1lc2NhbGUiOiIiLCJjb25maWciOnsiZGF0YXNldCI6InBhcmtzIiwib3B0aW9ucyI6e319fV0sInRpbWVzY2FsZSI6IiIsImRpc3BsYXlMZWdlbmQiOnRydWUsImFsaWduTW9udGgiOnRydWV9&location=11,49.22852,-123.12388). The hope with this question was to gain insight into how accessible washrooms are in city parks and perhaps assess how well a park is outfitted to meet the needs of a visitor.
## Project Objective:
* Data Analysis Process (DAP) is the methodical way of viewing data and discovering useful insights or patterns, helping to make decisions.
* It takes the form of steps including data collection, profiling, data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and ending with actionable conclusions.
* The dataset taken by me is about the  “Parks” segment of the “Parts, Recreation and Pets” module of the Vancouver city portal.
* In this we have key features like the ‘Park Name’, ‘Special Features’, ‘Facilities’, ‘Washroom’,  ‘Address’ and other details.
* From this, the main objective is to do descriptive analysis on “What is the count of parks in each ‘Neighbourhood’ of Vancouver recorded with a Washroom facility?” using this, we can further analyze the population segmentation around these areas and other details.
* We aldo do an exploratory analysis on question of “What is the count of Official Parks in each Neighbourhood?” to further analyse and find any trends available.
## Datasets
* There is one datasets which I will be using here.
* The dataset is **"Parks"**, it contains information about the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation maintains over 220 parks and 40 major facilities throughout the City of Vancouver.
* This dataset provides information of the parks and facilities that are available in them. Additional details are found in related datasets:
  * Parks washrooms
  * Parks facilities
  * Parks special features
* This data set contain the indformation of data columnc like:
  * ParkID: Id issued for each park
  * Name: Name issued for each park
  * Official: '1' if official and '0' if not
  * Advisories: 'N' if no and 'Y' if yes
  * Special Features: 'N' if no and 'Y' if yes
  * Facilities:'N' if no and 'Y' if yes
  * Washroom:'N' if no and 'Y' if yes
  * Street Number: The street number of park
  * Street Name: The name of the street of park
  * EW Street: The east-west street name of park
  * NS Street: The north-south street name of park
  * Neighbourhood  Name: The neighbourhood name of park
  * Neighbourhood url: The url pointing ti the Neighbourhood of park
  * Hectare: The are of park in hectares
  * GoogleMap Dest: The google destination coordinates of park
  * [2024-parks-infomration.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18117379/2024-parks-infomration.xlsx) contains the information of this dataset.
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is complex.
* This involves 3 stages namely:
### Step 1 - Descryptive Analysis of Vancouver city Parks (https://abdul-busi653.github.io/Descriptive-Analysis-of-Vancouver-City-Parks/)
* Data or Datasets are very important when we are going to analys
### Step 2 - Exploratory Analysis of Vancouver city Parks (https://abdul-busi653.github.io/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Vancouver-City-Parks/)
* Data or Datasets are very important when we are going to analys
### Step 3 - DAP Advanced Procedures of Data Enriching, Protection, Governance and Observability (https://abdul-busi653.github.io/Vancouver-City-Project-Advanced-DAP-Procedures/)
* Data or Datasets are very important when we are going to analys
